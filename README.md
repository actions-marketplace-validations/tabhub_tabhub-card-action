# TabHub Card Action 

TabHub Card Action helps you to generate your own album cards used in [TabHub Chrome Extension](https://tabhub.io). 

## Usage

For example, you can put your family's photos in a repo:

1. all these images must be put under a folder named `images` that we can call it an album or resource
2. you can have several `images` folders in different directories, and a manifest json file will be generated according to one `images` folder
3. if current directory already exists an `images` folder, those `images` folders in current sub directories wouldn't be included in result

then use this action to generate some `manifest.json`s that you can use to play these photos in a new tab of your Chrome(or Edge) browser, you can find the action will also generate a [README file](https://github.com/tabhub/tabhub-card-action/blob/master/ACTION_README_SAMPLE.md) for you that contains a list of manifest file's link.

### Add a resource manifest link in your TabHub

Copy a resource manifest link address from README file generated by the action and set it in the TabHub as below:
